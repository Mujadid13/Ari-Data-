214 of the 561 clusters in this dataset are marked at GAZ or gazetteered. The majority of these points were matched to their Tehsil (the 4th level administrative unit of Pakistan) and were assigned a point at the centroid of the Tehsil polygon. The displacement procedure moved these points from that centroid; however, there is still significant clustering of the points in places. It is unknown how much, if any, bias this may introduce to any analysis, including covariate extraction and interpolation. Please proceed with caution when using this dataset.
